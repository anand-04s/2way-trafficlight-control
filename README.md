# 2way-trafficlight-control
This project implements a two way traffic light controllerusing verilog HDL. The system automatically controls traffic signals for NORTH-SOUTH(NS) and EAST-WEST(EW) directions using a finite state machine(FSM). The design is simulated using Icarus Verilog and visualised in GTKWave to verify timing and state transitions.
